## 2026-06-15T07:47:22Z - Start isolated continuation

Goal:
- Finish Franka multi-object RL training with grasp prior, treating the handoff and current implementation as useful but not fully trusted.

Hypothesis:
- The stable-pose object initialization is likely close to correct, but multi-object grasp-prior candidate selection, verified-cache use, and/or validation/training wrapper wiring may still differ from the known-good single-cube Franka environment enough to break training.

Change:
- Created an isolated local worktree and branch from current main.
- No source edits yet.

Version Control:
- agent_id: dextrah-multiobject-grasp-prior-finish-20260615T074722Z

Result:

- key evidence: base commit is `ee2594e1320010e1f59c355aa6955c899b08a9df`; shared checkout had only unrelated untracked `worklogs/franka-star-kitting-rl/`.

Analysis:
- Follow-up work must use the isolated branch/worktree. Current live queue check showed no l401 jobs and only unrelated a1001 CPU job `29061545`.

Next:
- Audit single-cube versus multi-object reset/grasp-prior implementation, then patch the smallest confirmed bug set before cluster validation.

## 2026-06-15T08:04:00Z - Finger-level table gate and bounded validation scoring

Goal:
- Fix reset candidate selection so a selected multi-object grasp-prior reset cannot be considered table-valid merely because the EE frame is above the table.
- Prevent close-camera grasp-contact validation from stalling in unbounded pre-capture scoring.

Hypothesis:
- The current multi-object selector checks pregrasp EE z and contact-reference z for table safety, but the gripper bodies that collide with the table are the left/right finger bodies. The single-cube path catches some failures after IK, but multi-object candidate scoring can still waste attempts on physically invalid candidates before post-IK quality checks.
- Validation jobs stalled because `_select_scored_grasp_contact_state()` scored every quality candidate across many attempts with no wall-clock or env-count cap.

Change:
- Added EE-frame left/right finger offsets in `franka_multi_object_grasp_env.py`.
- Candidate selection now computes projected left/right finger positions for both pregrasp and exact-contact poses and requires both to clear the table floor.
- The post-selection topdown/table mask now uses selected projected finger clearances when available.
- Added `--grasp_contact_max_score_envs` and `--grasp_contact_max_score_seconds` to the multi-object video validation script.
- Exposed those validation caps in `cluster/sbatch_validate_franka_multi_object_grasp_videos_1gpu.sh`, defaulting to 4 candidate envs and 300 seconds.

Result:
- status: passed
- metrics/artifacts: local syntax and diff checks passed.
- key evidence: diff is limited to reset candidate table filtering, validation scoring caps, wrapper pass-through, and this worklog.

Analysis:
- This directly addresses the user constraint that reset sampling must not select gripper/table-colliding poses and should reject below-table or below-object approaches before training.
- It does not yet prove grasp robustness or training success; l401 validation must regenerate/verify current metrics after this commit.

Next:
- Commit, then continue audit and run cluster validation from the exact committed source.
